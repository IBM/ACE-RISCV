# Sailor: Automatic architectural vulnerability detector 

Sailor is a tool for automatic detection of security sensitive architecture-state using [Sail](https://github.com/rems-project/sail). Sailor has three components: A Scanner that parses machine-readable ISA specification written in the Sail language and extracts information about the ISA; An Analyzer that deploys our algorithm to determine security sensitive state that must be erased before switching to a new security domain; A Verifier that checks whether ISA-level security sensitive state has been detected correctly with the help of an existing tool Isla. Using the results from Sailor, we checked existing confidential computing frameworks for vulnerabilities at the architecture-level. We identified several vulnerabilities in the Keystone confidential computing framework and mounted different attacks: side-channel, covert-channel, computational integrity.

Getting started
---------------

## Setup dependencies 

### Python 

Install Python version 3.10.12 (that's the version Sailor has been tested on). 
It can be installed using [pyenv](https://medium.com/@aashari/easy-to-follow-guide-of-how-to-install-pyenv-on-ubuntu-a3730af8d7f0).

Run the following commands: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

On MacOS, you can run: 
```
brew install pyenv
```

Once pyenv is setup, add it to your system's PATH. For more details, check the [Pyenv setup guide](https://medium.com/@aashari/easy-to-follow-guide-of-how-to-install-pyenv-on-ubuntu-a3730af8d7f0) blogpost on Medium.  

Now you can use pyenv to install a specific version of python. 

```
pyenv install 3.10.12
pyenv local 3.10.12
``` 

### Sail 

We want to install the following versions of the toolchain: 

| Software | Version | 
|----|----|
| opam | 2.1.5 | 
| sail | 0.17.1 |
| ocaml | 4.13.1 |

[Here](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/blob/sail2/INSTALL.md) are the instructions to install Sail using opam.

Here's the output I see when I run the `which sail` command: 
```
/home/usr/.opam/ocaml-base-compiler.4.13.1/bin/sail
```

Here's the first line of output when I run the `sail --help` command: 
```
Sail 0.17.1 (sail @ opam-v2.1.5)
```

Setting up Isla
---------------

Refer [Isla Readme](https://github.com/rems-project/isla/tree/master)

### Install rust: (unix)

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

### Change rustc version

`rustup default 1.70.0`

### Install z3 (ensure to setup opam apriori)

To install a specific version of z3.
`opam install z3=4.12.6`

The above still leads to linker errors for me. So I am building it from [source](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

### Building z3 from source.

Step 1: Get source for the 4.12.6 version release.

Step 2: Set up Python2:

```
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 2.7.18
export PATH="$(pyenv root)/shims:${PATH}"
echo 'PATH=$(pyenv root)/shims:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc
pyenv init
```

Add the path init to ~/.zprofile and ~/.zshrc, then source them.
Use the following to switch to python2.

`pyenv shell 2.7.18`

Pyenv is a nice way to manage multiple python versions and quickly switch between them using the previous command.

Step 3: Now follow the 'Building Z3 using make and GCC/Clang' section to install z3.

Note: We just used g++ compiler instead of clang.

Once this step is complete, we should have the libz3.so/dylib file to link against. Copy it to the isla root directory.
Then, also set the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH to the isla root dir.

### Building and running Isla

Try `cargo build --release` for isla again and hope that it works. For me, it worked. No more linker errors.

Make sure you clone the isla-snapshots repository. After this step, running the isla-footprint command for Arm "add" instruction (the example from the readme in the isla repo) works.

### Running isla-footprint for RISC-V

Ideally we should rebuild the Isla IR snapshot for RISC-V. Refer to the [Isla README](https://github.com/rems-project/isla?tab=readme-ov-file#model-snapshots) to do that. Also read this discussion for generating isla footprints for RISC-V in one of their past [github issues](https://github.com/rems-project/isla/issues/82) (opened by me).

Once you can generate the traces and have setup the environment for Isla correctly, you can proceed to apply our patches to Isla.
